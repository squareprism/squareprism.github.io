<p><strong><a title="Edit “Product Design (and Marketing) based on user behavior”" href="http://squareprism.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=276&amp;action=edit">Product Design (and Marketing) based on user behavior</a></strong></p>
<p><a title="Behavior By Design Video" href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/07/behaviorbydesignvideo.html">An excellent article</a> by Nir Eyal that encourages product developers to build technology based on user behaviors. NIr suggests using a framework called the Desire Engine Canvas to think of how a product can engage users.</p>
<p>The beauty of the framework is it subtly makes product designers focus on "marketing" or "engaging" users with product features rather than just providing functionality. Nir recommends that a product user needs to be taken through desire engine cycles to form the habit of using your product.</p>
<p>The desire engine cycle consists of four simple steps, 1) an internal or external trigger, 2) an action by the user as soon as they use your product, 3) A variable reward for the action performed and 4) a commitment action performed by the user to move them to the next cycle. The hypothesis is that the faster one gets users get through a desire engine cycle and the faster users perform multiple cycles and form a habit. Once a habit is formed users keep coming back to your product or site driven by internal triggers!</p>
