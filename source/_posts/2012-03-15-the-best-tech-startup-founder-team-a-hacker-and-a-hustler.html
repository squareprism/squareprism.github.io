<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Best Tech startup founder team - A Hacker and a Hustler</strong></span></p>
<p>A great article from <a href="http://learntoduck.com/category/micah/">Micah </a>on who or what a Hacker/Hustler team is. Check out<a title="Hackers and Hustlers" href="http://learntoduck.com/micah/hackers-hustlers/"> Hacker and Hustlers</a>. This is how he defines hackers and hustlers</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Hacker</strong> </span>-Â  A Hacker is someone who looks the problem, and solves it in a unique and special way. A Hacker finds the process of problem solving exciting and interesting, and spends the majority of their time looking at the problem in multiple ways, finding many potential solutions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Hustler</strong> </span>- A Hustler on the other other hand is a relationship builder. Someone who can build direct relationships with their customers. They are passion people. They have the ability to articulate their passion clearly and in a way that gets other people equally passionate.</p>
<p>Something for me to keep coming back to as my search for a hustler (along with <a title="Search versus Execute" href="http://steveblank.com/2012/03/05/search-versus-execute/">searching for a business mode1</a>) continues.....</p>
